Welcome to the webscraper for Futurelearn.com of team 6 of the course online data collection. The webscraper is made by Saad Anwar, Dianne Burgess, Eva Bos and Jan van der Doe.

Futurelearn is a website that gives online courses on a variaty of subjects.

In het docs file you will find the documentation of the project, which contains questions and answers regarding the webscraper. The docs file also contains screenshots of the website Futurelearn, making clear where the webscraper gets its data from.

The gen folder contains the input (i.e. the course links) and the output of the webscraper (i.e. the raw data), as well as the cleaned data.

The src folder has the webscraper in the collection folder. The webscraper is built in Jupyter Notebook and is self-explanatory. The reporting contains an R file that cleans the data and generates many interesting graphs, some of which has been included in the documentation.

For example, you will see that the number of enrolments is significantly larger for courses that are endorsed and that language is by far the most popular category.
